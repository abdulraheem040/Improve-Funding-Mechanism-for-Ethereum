# Improve-Funding-Mechanism-for-Ethereum
Given a pair of repositories (𝐴, 𝐵), your model must output a single value 𝑤(𝐴) between 0 and 1 (the “weight” for repository 𝐴) that reflects their relative share. The weight for 𝐵 will be 1−𝑤(𝐴). For example, if projects 𝐴 and 𝐵 received $100 funding in total, and 𝐴 received $45, then 𝑤(𝐴) = 0.45 and 𝑤(𝐵) = 0.55.
